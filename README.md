# Destilerija
The project was done as a pre-examination requirement in the first year of study.
This is my first dynamic website that I made.
The site is intended for an online alcohol store

The user has the ability to: search and filter products, add products to the cart and create a order.

Local storage is used for data storage.
Due to the limitations of the knowledge and technology that I used, the creation of an order by the user is only a simulation, the order data is not processed or stored in the database.
The data about the articles is placed inside the JavaSctipt code from where their display on the page is generated.

All HTML, CSS and JavaScript code is hand written from start to finish.
The website is adapted for mobile phones and smaller screen resolutions.


On this project I am:
- Learned the basics of JavaScript
- Learned how Local Storage and Cookie work
- Improved knowledge of HTML
- Improved knowledge of CSS
